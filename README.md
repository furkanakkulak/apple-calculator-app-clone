# Apple Calculator App Clone

This project is a clone of the Apple calculator app, replicating both its user interface and functionality. The app is developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The calculator supports fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage and Negate Functions:** The app includes percentage and negate functions to perform quick calculations.
- **Keyboard Input Support:** Users can interact with the calculator using their keyboard. Digits 0-9 and the decimal point (.) can be used for number input, while arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /) allow for calculations. The Enter key computes results, and the Backspace key clears the last digit.

  - **Number Keys (0-9 and .):** Enter numerical values for calculations.
  - **Arithmetic Operators (+, -, \*, /):** Use these keys to perform arithmetic operations.
  - **Enter Key:** Compute results after entering a valid expression.
  - **Backspace Key:** Clear the last entered digit or operation.

- **Mobile-Responsive Design:** The app is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile users.
